## Lessons Learned
 I learned to carefully read the prompt before doing anything, at first I started by making a sort of menu with items in which it would ask the user to input money and return change. But that didnt meet the requirements of the user prompts. I believe it was a language barried, as I didnt understand what it meant by tendered.
